## Hi there 👋 <br> I'm Ladi! Welcome to my Github profile :)

I'm a Computer Science Student. Currently, my main project is a mobile application to assist in learning Brazilian Sign Language (Libras), using Dart and Flutter.

I really enjoy full-stack development and systems modeling. As for languages, I usually code in Python or Java (I'm exploring Spring Boot).

## Please feel free to contact me:
